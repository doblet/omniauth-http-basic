= OmniAuth::HttpBasic

OmniAuth stratgies for APIs that have HTTP Basic authentication.

This strategy is intended for developer's convinience, it will NOT set any uid or auth_hash data like a user strategy. So in most cases you need to create your own strategy by subclassing this strategy, and set uid and auth_hash there.

== Subclass Example (Recommended)

== Usage (Not Recommended)

Install manually or using Bundler:

    gem 'omniauth-http-basic'

Add :http_basic provider to omniauth builder:

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :http_basic, "https://example.com/user_info"
      # provider ...
    end
